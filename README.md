# Sql
Here I got my SQL hands-on experience, and I learned a lot of new things, like knowledge of all the essential SQL commands, SQL tools like GROUP BY, JOINS, and Subqueries, Improve my database's performance by using views and indexes, importing and cleaning data sets, analysing and visualising data, and building and evaluating machine learning models and pipelines in Python.

Here I have attached some databases for your reference.
